       "'In the novel, Nusya challenges traditional gender roles in several ways. Firstly, she is depicted as a strong and independent woman who actively participates in the resistance movement. Despite being seen as a \"wench\" by some of her male comrades, Nusya proves herself to be a valuable member of the insurgency, serving as Adrian\\'s courier for many years. This challenges the notion that women should only be confined to domestic roles and highlights their capability to contribute to political and military endeavors.\\n\\nAdditionally, Nusya\\'s behavior and mannerisms defy societal expectations of femininity. She is described as having a \"coy, kittenish\" demeanor, which is attributed to her conservative Polish upbringing and her flirtatious nature. However, the novel raises the question of whether Nusya\\'s behavior is a result of her own agency or a product of societal conditioning. Adrian initially dismisses her actions as a consequence of her upbringing and her tendency to flirt, but later wonders if women are capable of sacrificing themselves for an idea that is not tied to a personal relationship. This suggests that Nusya\\'s actions challenge traditional gender roles by questioning the extent to which women can be driven by their own independent ideals.\\n\\nFurthermore, Nusya\\'s emotional vulnerability is also portrayed in the novel, particularly during her parting with Adrian. She displays \"bursts of uncontainable sobbing\" and expresses her deep emotions to him. This challenges the stereotype of women as emotionally stable and submissive, as Nusya\\'s vulnerability and emotional expression are seen as a weakness by Adrian. However, it is important to note that Nusya\\'s emotions are not portrayed as a negative trait, but rather as a reflection of her humanity and her capacity to feel deeply.\\n\\nOverall, Nusya\\'s character challenges traditional gender roles by actively participating in the resistance movement, defying societal expectations of femininity, and expressing her emotions openly. Through her actions and behavior, she disrupts the notion that women are limited to domestic roles and highlights their agency and capacity for independent thought and action.'"
